# How Consignment Statements are Created

Consignment Statements are created automatically during a live auction and contains a list of all the items belonging to the consignor for that sale. It will list every detail for an item, like its starting price, if it sold or not, the sold price and any additional charges.

A Consignment Statement has 5 different statuses:

**New** - a Consignment Statement has been created.

**In process** - staff is working on the Consignment Statement.

**Finished** - the Consignment Statement is not accepting any further changes. When using the Print for Accounting button, the statement will automatically change to this status.

**Locked** - this is the same as finished, but also means that the statement was exported to a Microsoft Dynamics accounting system. This is an optional service. Please contact your account representative for more details.

**Canceled** - a staff member canceled the Consignment Statement.

**Second consignment -** As long as a Consignment Statement is open \(i.e **New** or **In process**\), every change made on an item, or on the additional charges will be updated on this Consignment Statement. As soon as the statement is closed \(i.e **Finished** or **Locked**\), changes made on an item will create a second Consignment Statement.

**What will trigger a new consignment entry?**

1. An unsold item has been sold.
2. A credit note was issued.
3. A new additional charge was added to the consignment. 
4. An item that was marked as "Don't pay consignor", was unchecked.
