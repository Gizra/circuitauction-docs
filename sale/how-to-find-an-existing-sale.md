# How to Find an Existing Sale

1. On the side menu go to **Sales**.
2. You have multiple ways to find a Sale in the table:

## Sorting

Click on the column header that you want to sort by.  
For example, click on the `Title` column header to sort the list by sales' title. Click again to change the order from ascending to descending and vice-versa.
