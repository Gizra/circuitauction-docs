# Sale context

Most of the information in the backoffice platform is menaged in a sale context, meaning when you create or watch the data (client's bids, items, consignments, etc.) it will display only the data that related to the selected sale.

### How to select the sale context?
On top of the screen start typing the sale id or sale name and select the desired sale from the autocomplete list.

When sale is selected you will see the sale context on the top.

### Remove the sale context
It is recomended to always work with sale context, but if for some reason you want to remove the sale context, just click on **Remove context**.  
Note that when removing the sale context, some of the data won't display correctly.
