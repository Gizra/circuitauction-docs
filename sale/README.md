# Sale

A sale is a group of lots \(items\) you will auction in one event. A sale can be 10 lots or 10,000 lots sold over 5 days.

On the sale dashboard you can find an overview of all the sales.

The color boxes on the top **\[1\]** display the total sales and the number of sales on each status.

The table **\[2\]** displays the sales list which you can [filter](how-to-find-an-existing-sale.md) by any column.

## Statuses

**New** - A new sale is created and pending editing. The sale in this status is not publish on the website. 
**In Process** - The sale is being edited and is still not publish on the website.   
**Ready to publish** - This status will trigger a sync to the website. When completed, the status will change to `Published on site`.  
**Published on site** - The sale is published on website. 
**Post sale purchase** - The sale is after the auction but still allows items to be purchased. The sale is published on website.
**Finished** - Closed sale of past auction.

**Note**: if you want to make a change in a published sale, you need first to change the status to `In Process` and after done changing, set the status to `Ready to publish` so the changes will be sync to the website.
