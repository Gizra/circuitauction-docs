A sale is a group of lots \(items\) you will auction in one event. A sale can be 10 lots or 10,000 lots sold over 5 days.

On the sale dashboard you can find an overview of all the sales.

The table **\[2\]** displays the sales list which you can [filter](how-to-find-an-existing-sale.md) by any column.
