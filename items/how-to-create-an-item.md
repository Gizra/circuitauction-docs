# How to create an item?

Best practice is to [create an item directly from consignment](../consignment/how-to-add-an-item-to-consignment.md).  
unless it is an item from the auction house inventory.

1. Make sure you are on the right [sale context](../sale/sale-context.md).
2. On the side menu go to **Items**
3. Click on `+create new item`

4. Fill in the item's information, pay attention to these fields:  
**Item Information** - you can enter the item description in several languages. Click on one of the language button (i.e EN, DE, HE etc.) to fill in the item information fields with content on that language. For example: click on EN button and fill in the **Title**, **Sub title** and **Description** in English. Then click on DE button and fill in the same fields in Deutsch.  
For easier content entry in another language, click on **Show other languages** to open block with the fields in other languages than you are looking at. Use this to easily translate the item while viewing both languages.

**Images** - Click on **Select image** and choose the item image from your local folder.  
You can add images to all sale's items without the need to manually upload them one by one. See [How to mass upload items images](../sale/how-to-mass-upload-items-images.md).  

**Sale Info** - make sure the right sale populate in the **Sale** field. In **Temporary lot** field you can enter a temporary number assigned to this lot before the [final lot number](../sale/how-to-assign-lot-numbers.md) is added.  

**Packages** - select the type of package. If you leave empty, the default is envelope. This will be used to calculate the shipping costs.  

**Public message** - you can add a special message that will display to *ALL* bidders when this lot is the active lot during live auction.

**Auctioneer Notes** - add a private message displayed only to the auctioneer screen when this lot is the active lot during live auction.  

**Consignment** - an item should always be associated with a consignment, unless it is an item from the auction house inventory. In that case, check the **Auction house inventory**.

**Withdrawn** - item marked as "withdrawn" will only appear as part of the sale, but will be disabled for bidding. Use this if you have added an item to the sale but there is a problem with it and you canâ€™t offer it on the live auction.

5. When you've finished entering the item information, click **Save**.  You can always come back and edit the item.
