# Items

An item is the individual lot you will auction. An item can be a single article or collection of articles, but it will be bid on as one item.

On the items dashboard you can find an overview of all items. Select a [sale context](../sale/sale-context.md) to see just the items that belong to the current sale, or remove the sale context to see all items **[1]**.

The color boxes at the top **[2]** display the total number of items and the number of items in each status.  

Table **[3]** displays the items list which you can [filter](../items/how-to-find-an-existing-item.md) by any column.
