# How to Select the Bidding Item

When an item is marked as **Gone** \(see [Auction Flow](../auction-flow.md)\), the next item will display automatically. You can also select a specific item manually.

## Select the item manually

1. Click on the **Now Bidding** field and select the item.
2. After selecting the item, click on the **arrow** to set the item. Note that if you don't click the arrow the selected item won't be uploaded.
