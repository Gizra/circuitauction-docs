# How to place a bid from the floor

Bids can be placed only when item marked as **Active** or **Going** \(see [auction flow](../auction-flow.md)\).

Bid from the web placed automatically. Bid from the room placed manually by the clerk.

**Place a bid from the room**

1. Click on the **Place a bid** button to place a bid on the next step. OR Enter bid value in the **Next bid** field if you don't want to be limited by the next step.

3. If there is a conflict between bid that was placed from web and bid that was placed from the floor, you can click on **Set to floor** to set the bid from the room.
