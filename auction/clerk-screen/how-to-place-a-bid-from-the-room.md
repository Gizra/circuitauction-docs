# How to Place a Bid from the Floor

Bids can be placed only when an item is marked as **Active** or **Going** \(see [Auction Flow](../auction-flow.md)\).

Bids from the web are placed automatically. Bids from the room are placed manually by the clerk.

**Placing a bid from the room**

1. Click on the **Place bid** button to place a bid on the next step. OR enter a bid value in the **Next bid** field if you don't want to be limited by the next step.

1. If there is a conflict between a bid that was placed from the web and a bid that was placed from the floor, you can click on **Set to floor** to set the bid to the room.
