# Understanding the client page

On top of the page you will find some tabs.

### Client tab
Under the `Client` tab you can find information about the client, dividing to sections: basic information like name and contact deatials, information that related to the auction and financial information.

(explain here about special fields like: address, worning...)


On the buttom of the client tab you can see a list of the revision of the client page content.

### Bidding info
Under the `Bidding info` tab you can see the client's bids on the [current sale](../sale/sale-context.md), and also [place a new bid](../client/how-to-place-a-bid-for-a-client.md) for this client.
 

### Reports
Under the `Reports` tab you can create a [bidding report](../client/how-to-send-a-bidding-report-to-a-client.md) and send it to the client.
