# How to approve a client?

There are two levels of client approvement:

* Approve the person as a client that can participate in the auction house activities. This is done by changing the client status to **Approved** \(see explanation below\). 
* Approve credit for a client \(bidder\) that he/she can use for bidding. This is done by approving credit requests \(see explanation below\).

## Changing client status to Approved

1. On the side menu go to **Clients**.
2. Filter the table by selecting the status = `Pending` or `New`. ![clients\_\_\_backoffice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20393485/44981608-c2de8000-af7b-11e8-8407-7754054a7c05.jpg)
3. Change the status of the desired client to `Approved` \(or `Unapproved` if you don't want to approve this client\). ![clients\_\_\_backoffice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20393485/44981582-ab9f9280-af7b-11e8-800b-5945a93d6d60.jpg)

**Note:** if you want to go over the client's data before approving, click on the eye icon in the table to enter the [client page](understanding-client-page.md), and then you can change the client status from the page itself. ![itamar\_bar-lev\_-\_710075\_\_\_backoffice](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20393485/44981546-8c086a00-af7b-11e8-9417-2a1d67e72abd.jpg)
