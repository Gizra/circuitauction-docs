# Tasks

You can create different types of tasks and assign them to different people in your organization. Tasks are referenced to these entities: clients, consignments, items, sales, orders.

1. Go to the entity page (client, consignment, item, sale or order) you want to create a task for.
2. Click on the **Tasks** button. The number on the button represents the number of the active (not complete) tasks.

### Default / Dependent tasks
In the backend of the system, Admin can define**default tasks** that will be created automatically. For example: every time a user creates new consignment, a task says: “create item out of consignment” will be created and assign to the right staff member.
Admin can also define**tasks that will depend on another task**. For example: task says: “editing item” can start only after task says: “creating item” is complete.
